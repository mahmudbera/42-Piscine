# 42-Piscine
This repository contains all the projects I completed during the Piscine, an intensive four-week coding bootcamp that serves as the entrance exam for Ã‰cole 42. Here, you'll find detailed descriptions of each project, the learning objectives, and the skills I developed through these assignments.

# Projects
### Shell
This project involves writing simple shell scripts to perform various tasks. It helps participants become familiar with the Unix shell and basic command-line operations.

### C Projects
The core of the Piscine involves extensive practice with the C programming language. Participants complete a series of exercises that cover fundamental programming concepts, from basic syntax and control structures to more complex topics like pointers and memory management.

### Rushes
Rushes are weekend projects where participants work in teams to complete a challenging programming task within a limited timeframe. These projects encourage collaboration and rapid problem-solving.
